# ai-playground-gradio-langchain

Here is my plan for the AI playground platform using Gradio, Langchain, and various AI models:

Assumptions:

This will be a web-based platform using Python and the Gradio library for the UI
It will integrate with AI models from providers like GROQ and OpenAI
The Langchain framework will be used to abstract and simplify interacting with the different AI models
Users can select different AI models to experiment with and provide prompts to get AI generated outputs
UI Approach:

Use Gradio to create a simple, intuitive web UI
Have a dropdown to select the AI model provider (e.g. OpenAI, GROQ, etc)
Show inputs for API keys and other configuration for the selected provider
Provide a large text input for the user prompt
Have a button to submit the prompt to the selected AI model
Display the AI generated output in a text area
Allow downloading the output
Provide clear error messages if anything goes wrong
Use Tailwind CSS to style the UI in a clean, modern style
Code Approach:

Use Python and the Gradio library to create the web app
Integrate the Langchain framework to abstract the AI model providers
Write modular, documented code
Have a main app.py that defines the Gradio UI
Put provider-specific code in separate files
Use environment variables for API keys and secrets
Add logging for easier debugging
Implement error handling
Keep sensitive info out of version control
Provide clear setup instructions in a README

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GPT-Engineer-App/ai-playground-gradio-langchain.git
cd ai-playground-gradio-langchain
npm i
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will run a dev server with auto reloading and an instant preview.
